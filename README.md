# Google-Play-Store-Classification-Project
In this project, we undertook a detailed logistic regression analysis of the Google Play Store dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset offered insights into various aspects of apps available on the Google Play Store, including categories, ratings, reviews, installations, and, crucially, whether they were free or paid.
